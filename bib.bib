title = {Real-Time Smoke Rendering Using Compensated Ray Marching},
year = {2007},
month = {September},
abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm called compensated ray marching for rendering of smoke under dynamic low-frequency environment lighting. Our approach is based on a decomposition of the input smoke animation, represented as a sequence of volumetric density fields, into a set of radial basis functions (RBFs) and a sequence of residual fields. To expedite rendering, the source radiance distribution within the smoke is computed from only the low-frequency RBF approximation of the density fields, since the high-frequency residuals have little impact on global illumination under low-frequency environment lighting. Furthermore, in computing source radiances the contributions from single and multiple scattering are evaluated at only the RBF centers and then approximated at other points in the volume using an RBF-based interpolation. A slice-based integration of these source radiances along each view ray is then performed to render the final image. The high-frequency residual fields, which are a critical component in the local appearance of smoke, are compensated back into the radiance integral during this ray march to generate images of high detail. The runtime algorithm, which includes both light transfer simulation and ray marching, can be easily implemented on the GPU, and thus allows for real-time manipulation of viewpoint and lighting, as well as interactive editing of smoke attributes such as extinction cross section, scattering albedo, and phase function. Only moderate preprocessing time and storage is needed. This approach provides the first method for real-time smoke rendering that includes single and multiple scattering while generating results comparable in quality to offline algorithms like ray tracing.},

Our algorithm includes effects such as volume caustics and multiple volume scattering, is not restricted to certain classes of geometry and scattering models and has minimal memory requirements. Furthermore, it is unbiased and robust, in the sense that it produces satisfactory results for a wide range of input scenes and lighting situations within acceptable time bounds.",

abstract = {Volume rendering is a technique for visualizing sampled scalar or vector fields of three spatial dimensions without fitting geometric primitives to the data. A subset of these techniques generates images by computing 2-D projections of a colored semitransparent volume, where the color and opacity at each point are derived from the data using local operators. Since all voxels participate in the generation of each image, rendering time grows linearly with the size of the dataset. This paper presents a front-to-back image-order volume-rendering algorithm and discusses two techniques for improving its performance. The first technique employs a pyramid of binary volumes to encode spatial coherence present in the data, and the second technique uses an opacity threshold to adaptively terminate ray tracing. Although the actual time saved depends on the data, speedups of an order of magnitude have been observed for datasets of useful size and complexity. Examples from two applications are given: medical imaging and molecular graphics.},

abstract = {The study of the physical process of light interacting with matter is an important part of computer image synthesis since it forms the basis for calculations of intensities in the picture. The simpler models used in the past are being augmented by more complex models gleaned from the physics literature. This paper is another step in the direction of assimilating such knowledge. It concerns the statistical simulation of light passing through and being reflected by clouds of similar small particles. (It does not, however, address the cloud structure modeling problem). By extension it can be applied to surfaces completely covered by dust and is therefore a physical basis for various theories of diffuse reflection.},

abstract = {The rendering equation is similar to the linear Boltzmann equation which has been widely studied in physics and nuclear engineering. Consequently, many of the powerful techniques which have been developed in these fields can be applied to problems in image synthesis. In this paper we adapt several statistical techniques commonly used in neutron transport to stochastic ray tracing and, more generally, to Monte Carlo solution of the rendering equation. First, we describe a technique known as Russian roulette which can be used to terminate the recursive tracing of rays without introducing statistical bias. We also examine the practice of creating ray trees in classical ray tracing in the light of a well-known technique in particle transport known as splitting. We show that neither ray trees nor paths as described in [10] constitute an optimal sampling plan in themselves and that a hybrid may be more efficient.},

abstract = {Evaluating transmittance within participating media is a fundamental operation required by many light transport algorithms. We present ratio tracking and residual tracking, two complementary techniques that can be combined into an efficient, unbiased estimator for evaluating transmittance in complex heterogeneous media. In comparison to current approaches, our new estimator is unbiased, yields high efficiency, gracefully handles media with wavelength dependent extinction, and bridges the gap between closed form solutions and purely numerical, unbiased approaches. A key feature of ratio tracking is its ability to handle negative densities. This in turn enables us to separate the main part of the transmittance function, handle it analytically, and numerically estimate only the residual transmittance. In addition to proving the unbiasedness of our estimators, we perform an extensive empirical analysis to reveal parameters that lead to high efficiency. Finally, we describe how to integrate the new techniques into a production path tracer and demonstrate their benefits over traditional unbiased estimators.},

We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal.
