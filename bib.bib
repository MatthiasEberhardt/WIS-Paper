abstract = {In the past few years the movie industry has switched over from stochastic rasterisation approaches to using physically based light transport simulation: path tracing in production has become ubiquitous across studios. The new approach came with undisputed advantages such as consistent lighting, progressive previews, and fresh code bases. But also abandoning 30 years of experience meant some hard cuts affecting all stages such as lighting, look development, geometric modelling, scene description formats, the way we schedule for multi-threading, just to name a few. This means there is a rich set of people involved and as an expert in either one of these aspects it is easy to lose track of the big picture.This is part I of a full-day course, and it focuses on the necessary background knowledge. In this part, we would like to provide context for everybody interested in understanding the challenges behind writing renderers intended for movie production work. In particular we will give an insight into movie production requirements for new students and academic researchers. On the other side we will lay a solid mathematical foundation to develop new ideas to solve problems in this context.To further illustrate, part II of the course will focus on materials (acquisition and production requirements) and showcase practical efforts by prominent professionals in the field, pointing out unexpected challenges encountered in new shows and unsolved problems as well as room for future work wherever appropriate.},

title = {Real-Time Smoke Rendering Using Compensated Ray Marching},
year = {2007},
month = {September},
abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm called compensated ray marching for rendering of smoke under dynamic low-frequency environment lighting. Our approach is based on a decomposition of the input smoke animation, represented as a sequence of volumetric density fields, into a set of radial basis functions (RBFs) and a sequence of residual fields. To expedite rendering, the source radiance distribution within the smoke is computed from only the low-frequency RBF approximation of the density fields, since the high-frequency residuals have little impact on global illumination under low-frequency environment lighting. Furthermore, in computing source radiances the contributions from single and multiple scattering are evaluated at only the RBF centers and then approximated at other points in the volume using an RBF-based interpolation. A slice-based integration of these source radiances along each view ray is then performed to render the final image. The high-frequency residual fields, which are a critical component in the local appearance of smoke, are compensated back into the radiance integral during this ray march to generate images of high detail. The runtime algorithm, which includes both light transfer simulation and ray marching, can be easily implemented on the GPU, and thus allows for real-time manipulation of viewpoint and lighting, as well as interactive editing of smoke attributes such as extinction cross section, scattering albedo, and phase function. Only moderate preprocessing time and storage is needed. This approach provides the first method for real-time smoke rendering that includes single and multiple scattering while generating results comparable in quality to offline algorithms like ray tracing.},

abstract = {Volume rendering is a technique for visualizing sampled scalar or vector fields of three spatial dimensions without fitting geometric primitives to the data. A subset of these techniques generates images by computing 2-D projections of a colored semitransparent volume, where the color and opacity at each point are derived from the data using local operators. Since all voxels participate in the generation of each image, rendering time grows linearly with the size of the dataset. This paper presents a front-to-back image-order volume-rendering algorithm and discusses two techniques for improving its performance. The first technique employs a pyramid of binary volumes to encode spatial coherence present in the data, and the second technique uses an opacity threshold to adaptively terminate ray tracing. Although the actual time saved depends on the data, speedups of an order of magnitude have been observed for datasets of useful size and complexity. Examples from two applications are given: medical imaging and molecular graphics.},

It concerns the statistical simulation of light passing through and being reflected by clouds of similar small particles. (It does not, however, address the cloud structure modeling problem). By extension it can be applied to surfaces completely covered by dust and is therefore a physical basis for various theories of diffuse reflection.},

abstract = {The rendering equation is similar to the linear Boltzmann equation which has been widely studied in physics and nuclear engineering. Consequently, many of the powerful techniques which have been developed in these fields can be applied to problems in image synthesis. In this paper we adapt several statistical techniques commonly used in neutron transport to stochastic ray tracing and, more generally, to Monte Carlo solution of the rendering equation. First, we describe a technique known as Russian roulette which can be used to terminate the recursive tracing of rays without introducing statistical bias. We also examine the practice of creating ray trees in classical ray tracing in the light of a well-known technique in particle transport known as splitting. We show that neither ray trees nor paths as described in [10] constitute an optimal sampling plan in themselves and that a hybrid may be more efficient.},

In comparison to current approaches, our new estimator is unbiased, yields high efficiency, gracefully handles media with wavelength dependent extinction, and bridges the gap between closed form solutions and purely numerical, unbiased approaches. A key feature of ratio tracking is its ability to handle negative densities. This in turn enables us to separate the main part of the transmittance function, handle it analytically, and numerically estimate only the residual transmittance. In addition to proving the unbiasedness of our estimators, we perform an extensive empirical analysis to reveal parameters that lead to high efficiency.

Doing so, we also prove that null-collision algorithms can be slightly modified so that they deal with unexpected occurrences of negative values of the null-collision coefficient (when the upper bound of the heterogeneous extinction coefficient is nonstrict). We then describe technically, in full details, the resulting algorithm, when applied to the evaluation of the local net-power density within a bounded, heterogeneous, multiple scattering and emitting/absorbing medium. The corresponding integral formulation is then explored theoretically in order to distinguish the statistical significance of introducing null-collisions from that of the integral-structure underlying modification.}

abstract={Rendering participating media is important for a number of domains, ranging from commercial applications (entertainment, virtual reality) to simulation systems (driving, flying, and space simulators) and safety analyses (driving conditions, sign visibility). This article surveys global illumination algorithms for environments including participating media. It reviews both appearance-based and physically-based media methods, including the single-scattering and the more general multiple-scattering techniques. The objective of the survey is the characterization of all these methods: identification of their base techniques, assumptions, limitations, and range of utilization. It concludes with some reflections about the suitability of the methods depending on the specific application involved, and possible future research lines.},

abstract = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

abstract = {In recent years point-based geometry has gained increasing attention as an alternative surface representation, both for efficient rendering and for flexible geometry processing of highly complex 3D-models. Point-sampled objects do neither have to store nor to maintain globally consistent topological information. Therefore they are more flexible compared to triangle meshes when it comes to handling highly complex or dynamically changing shapes. In this paper, we make an attempt to give an overview of the various point-based methods that have been proposed over the last years. In particular we review and evaluate different shape representations, geometric algorithms, and rendering methods, which use points as a universal graphics primitive.}
